# Experiment 4: Aggregate Functions, Group By and Having Clause
## NAME: ABISHA LINU L
## REGISTER NUMBER: 212224040011
## AIM
To study and implement aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clause with suitable examples.

## THEORY

### Aggregate Functions
These perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- **MIN()** – Smallest value  
- **MAX()** – Largest value  
- **COUNT()** – Number of rows  
- **SUM()** – Total of values  
- **AVG()** – Average of values

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### GROUP BY
Groups records with the same values in specified columns.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```
### HAVING
Filters the grouped records based on aggregate conditions.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;
```

**Question 1**

Write a SQL query to return the total number of rows in the 'customer' table where the city is not Noida.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM customer
WHERE city!='Noida';
```

**Output:**

**Question 5**
---
Write a SQL query to calculate the average purchase amount of all orders. Return average purchase amount.

Sample table: orders

ord_no purch_amt ord_date customer_id salesman_id

70001 150.5 2012-10-05 3005 5002

70009 270.65 2012-09-10 3001 5005

70002 65.26 2012-10-05 3002 5001

```
SELECT AVG(purch_amt) AS AVERAGE
FROM orders;
```

**Output:**

**Question 6**
---
Write a SQL query to determine the number of customers who received at least one grade for their activity.

Sample table: customer

customer_id | cust_name | city | grade | salesman_id

-------------+----------------+------------+-------+-------------

    3002 | Nick Rimando   | New York   |   100 |        5001

    3007 | Brad Davis     | New York   |   200 |        5001

    3005 | Graham Zusi    | California |   200 |        5002

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM customer
WHERE grade IS NOT NULL;
```

**Question 8**
---
Write the SQL query that achieves the grouping of data by age intervals using the expression (age/5)5, calculates the total salary sum for each group, and excludes groups where the total salary sum is not greater than 5000.

SELECT (age/5)*5 AS age_group,SUM(salary)
FROM customer1
GROUP BY age_group
HAVING SUM(salary)>5000;
```

**Output:**

**Question 9**
---
Write the SQL query that achieves the grouping of data by city, calculates the average income for each city, and includes only those cities where the average income is greater than 500,000.

```
SELECT city,AVG(income)

GROUP BY city
HAVING AVG(income)>500000;
```

**Output:**

<img width="573" height="406" alt="506092156-808fd86f-8fe0-486b-8ac8-a4d2699d7305" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5587ac7d-d672-4383-9ae0-2eafbaa5193f" />

GROUP BY occupation
HAVING AVG(workhour) BETWEEN 10 AND 12;
